## Why We Make PiSugar

In the last few months, we have been working on projects base on Pi zero. It always comes to my mind that why we choose this tiny thing, to build a new portable product.

We believe perfect size will completely change the way we think.
We also believe in delicacy and better experience, which are essential for electronic circuit board.

After trying a number of power supply solutions, we found that none of them is elegent enough.
So we decide make it by ourselves. 

We call it PiSugar PowerPack — a power module specially designed for raspberry pi zero/pi zero w.

The sizes of circuit board and bettery perfectly match raspberry pi zero. You can easy put your prototypes in small cases.

#### Easy to Install
Install in one minute. No need for welding. Friendly for beginners.

#### USB Charging
Charge via micro USB port. Also you can charge when it is running a raspberry pi zero.

#### On-board Switch
One tap to turn on, dual taps to turn it off. No need to detach.
